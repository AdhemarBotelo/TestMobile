Problem:
We’re trying to find people who is able to write high quality code using design patterns and good practices writing software. 
So that you must design an application to Car shop and this application must save every car in the store.
the information must be saved for each car: 
● How many seats up to 
● Price
● It’s new or used 
● Model 
● Date released 
● Category:  o Just can be Electric, truck or commercial
o If electronic car, the app must save battery capacity o If it is a truck, 
the app must save it has a max available payload o And if it is commercial, the app must save space capacity
o All vehicle can be saved, modified and read, except to electronic car, this cannot be modified. 
o The application must be able to create more categories
